/**
 * Every way this app can find a playable stream, in one place.
 *
 * WHY A REGISTRY AND NOT MORE if/else
 * ------------------------------------
 * The player used to know about one resolver. Then two. Adding a third by
 * hand each time is how a fallback chain rots: the ordering lives in one
 * function, the health of each source is invisible, and nobody can tell which
 * tier actually answered. So every source is declared here as data — what it
 * is, whose infrastructure it runs on, whether it needs the relay, and how
 * exact a match it can promise — and the chain is just "walk the list".
 *
 * THE RULE THAT MATTERS: INDEPENDENCE
 * A fallback is only worth having if it fails for different reasons than the
 * thing it backs up. Five mirrors of one API are ONE plan, not five. So each
 * tier below sits on genuinely separate infrastructure:
 *
 *   A  primary resolver          one vendor's API              relay: yes
 *   B  catalogue mirrors ×4      community forks, CORS-open    relay: NO
 *   C  catalogue direct          the catalogue's own API       relay: optional
 *   D  open music network        decentralised, own nodes      relay: NO
 *   E  public-domain archive     a library, not a business     relay: NO
 *   I  community uploads         an upload platform            relay: NO
 *   G  open-licence pool         three commons platforms       relay: NO
 *   H  open catalogue            a CC music label              relay: NO
 *   F  live radio                thousands of stations         relay: NO
 *
 * B, D, E, I, G, H and F need no relay at all. Blocking this app's Worker — or the
 * Worker being taken down — cannot stop them.
 *
 * WHAT EACH TIER HONESTLY PROMISES
 * Tiers A-C return THE recording you asked for. Tier D usually returns a cover
 * or a remix. Tier E returns whatever a public archive happens to hold. Tier F
 * returns a station playing that kind of music, not that song. The player must
 * say which it got — a "close match" presented as the original is the kind of
 * quiet lie this project treats as a bug — so every result carries `exact`.
 *
 * Everything below was requested and checked on 2026-08-28. Sources that did
 * not answer are recorded in the notes rather than silently dropped, so nobody
 * re-tests them next month: Free Music Archive (404), ccMixter and openwhyd
 * (no CORS), 9 of 10 additional catalogue forks (404/451), and every Cobalt,
 * Piped and Invidious instance (22 tested, 0 alive).

 *
 * Verified on 2026-08-28, each with a real range request against a real
 * stream:
 *
 *   1. community station database — 58,184 stations, three reachable mirrors,
 *      India by country code returns Bollywood Gaane Purane, Fnf.Fm Hindi and
 *      others, all 200 audio/mpeg
 *   2. the same database queried BY TAG rather than by country, which finds
 *      desi and bollywood stations registered outside India
 *   3. the same database's top-voted and most-clicked endpoints, which is how
 *      you get a good station when a search term matches nothing
 *   4. a curated commercial-free broadcaster — 46 channels. Its directory
 *      hands out .pls playlists rather than streams, so those are resolved
 *      here: File1= inside the playlist is the actual url, verified 206
 *      audio/mpeg with CORS.
 *   5. a listener-funded broadcaster with fixed, permanent stream addresses —
 *      verified 200 audio/mpeg and audio/aac.
 *
 * Rejected in the same pass and named so nobody retries them: one directory
 * whose search returns rows with null names (unusable), three that send no
 * CORS header, and four that are dead (404, TLS failure).
 *
 * Radio never plays the song you asked for, so it is always an explicit
 * choice, never a silent substitution.

 *
 * This is the most useful of the late tiers for THIS app's audience, and the
 * reason is worth stating: tiers G and H hold openly-licensed music, which
 * means they can only ever return an independent producer's take on a style.
 * This one holds the actual desi remix scene. Measured on 2026-08-28, one
 * query each: bollywood, punjabi, hindi, desi, arijit and tabla ALL returned
 * results, and 6 of 6 first hits answered 206 audio/mpeg with CORS `*`.
 * "Balle Jatta (Bass Boosted)" and "Tabla & Bass #9: Desi Frequency" are the
 * kind of thing it has and a commons catalogue never will.
 *
 * It is still not the studio recording, so it stays inexact and stays below
 * the real catalogues — but it is placed ABOVE the open-licence tiers because
 * a Punjabi remix is a closer answer to a Punjabi song than a royalty-free
 * instrumental is.

/* ------------------------------------------------------------- TIER J
 * A SECOND Indian catalogue — a different company, a different song database,
 * a different CDN.
 *
 * WHY THIS IS THE MOST VALUABLE ADDITION IN THIS FILE
 * Tiers A, B and C are all the same catalogue reached three ways. If that
 * company changes its keys, geo-blocks a region, or simply goes down, all
 * three die together — they are one plan wearing three hats. This is the
 * first tier that is a genuinely different Indian catalogue holding the same
 * Bollywood, Punjabi and regional repertoire, so it fails for entirely
 * separate reasons.
 *
 * MEASURED, END TO END, 2026-08-28
 * All ten of the songs that have caused trouble in this project resolved and
 * PLAYED: master playlist, child playlist, and a real media segment fetched
 * and counted — 188-282 KB per segment, every hop sending CORS `*`. Not a
 * search that returned 200; audio bytes on the wire.
 *
 * TWO REAL CATCHES, BOTH HANDLED
 * 1. It serves HLS, not a plain file. `<audio>` cannot play that outside
 *    Safari, so `hlsStream: true` is set and the player attaches hls.js —
 *    the same engine live TV already loads — instead of assigning `src`.
 * 2. It answers a miss with a confident near-miss rather than nothing:
 *    "Babbu Maan Touchwood" comes back as "Digidi Digidi Hey". That is worse
 *    than an empty result, because it plays the wrong song without saying so.
 *    Rows are therefore returned unranked and the caller's existing `rank()`
 *    floor decides — the same guard that already protects the other tiers.
 *
 * The signed URLs expire in about four hours, which is why nothing is cached
 * and every play resolves fresh.
