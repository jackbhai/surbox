/**
 * Upstream endpoints, in one place and under neutral names.
 *
 * Nothing in the product surface names a vendor. The labels the user sees —
 * the "via …" line under a result and the system-status list — describe WHAT
 * a source is ("Manga library", "Media resolver"), never who runs it. Keeping
 * every base URL here means a provider can be swapped without touching a
 * single screen, and no component carries a host string.
 *
 * The host is decoded at runtime rather than written as a literal, so the name
 * does not appear when someone searches the shipped bundle. Splitting it into
 * an array was not enough: the minifier kept the fragments verbatim and a
 * plain grep still found them.
 *
 * Honest note for maintainers: this is cosmetic, not a security boundary. Any
 * request is still visible in the browser's network tab. The point is that the
 * product never advertises where it sources from.
